# Symple Server

The Symple Node.js server is a real time messaging server built on top of `socket.io` and `redis` for creating blazing fast messaging applications quickly and easily. Use cases include chat, sms, media streaming, and games that run in the web browser, desktop, or on mobile devices.

Symple is a unrestrictive real time messaging and presence protocol that implements the minimum number of features required to build full fledged messaging applications with security, flexibility, performance and scalability in mind. These features include:

* Session sharing with any backend (via Redis)
* User rostering and presence
* Media streaming (via WebRTC, [see demo](symple.sourcey.com))
* Scoped messaging ie. direct, user and group scope
* Real-time commands and events
* Real-time forms

## Installation

```bash
npm install symple
```

## Usage

To get started straight away fire up the default server by typing:

```bash
node server

# or 

npm start
```

The `server.js` file in the root directory of the repo provides a code example of how to include and extend the Symple server:


```bash
// include Symple
var symple = require('./symple');

// instantiate the Symple server
var sy = new symple();

// load a config file
sy.loadConfig(__dirname + "/config.json");

// initialize the server
sy.init();

// access socket.function functions if required
// sy.io.use(function(socket, next) { });
```

See the [configuration options](#configuration) below for a list of available options.

Once the server is up and running you need a client to connect to it. There are a few options in the following languages:

* JavaScript: https://github.com/sourcey/symple-client
* Ruby: https://github.com/sourcey/symple-client-ruby
* C++: https://github.com/sourcey/libsourcey/tree/master/src/symple

## Configuration

The configure the server just modify `config.json` as needed:

```
{
  /* The port to listen on */
  "port" : 4500,  
  
  /* Allow anonymous connections */
  "anonymous" : false,  
    
  /* Redis configuration (required if anonymous == false) */
  "redis" : {
    "host" : "127.0.0.1",
    "port" : 6379,
    "password" : ""
  },
  
  /* SSL configuration (required if using HTTPS) */
  "ssl" : {
    "enabled" : false,
    "key" : "/path/to/.key",
    "cert" : "/path/to/.crt"
  }
}
```
