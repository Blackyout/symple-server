# Symple Node.js Server

The Symple server is a server-side module which connects clients and routes messages using the Symple protocol. 

## What is Symple?

Symple is a presence and messaging protocol which is semantically similar to XMPP, except that it is unrestrictive and vastly simplified, and it used JSON instead of XML for encoding messages. Symple also has a C++ client which makes it ideas for messaging and remoting between desktop, mobile and browser clients.

## How to use it

1. Clone the ```symple-server``` repository.
2. Copy ```config.json.default``` to ```config.json``` and edit as required.
3. Fire up the Node.js server ```node server```
